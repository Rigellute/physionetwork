                    <h3>Who created this site</h3>
                    <p><a href="http://sw12694.smart-web.dk"><strong>The Spine Surgery London</strong></a> has a multidisciplinary team of consultants specialising in all aspects of spinal care. Conducting over 6000 consultations a year, they have over 130 years of clinical experience between them. They provide medical services to premiere league football and rugby teams, World Cups, Olympic Games, NFL, horse racing, boxing, Grand Prix racing, The Royal Ballet, leading multinationals, stars of the stage and screen - as well as the rest of us! They have pioneered new treatments including the latest in endoscopic spinal surgery, artificial disc replacement and antibiotics for low back pain. They have expertise in orthopaedics, neurosurgery, neurology, rheumatology, sport and exercise medicine along with podiatry and ergonomics.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Over all these years, over all these levels and in all these disciplines their work has brought them into daily contact with physical therapists of all types: physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractics, acupuncturists Pilates instructors, massage therapists, personal trainers etc, etc.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Recognising that these physical therapies form a crucial part patient care their aim here is to bring you the best physical therapists they have found.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The Spine Surgery London apologises for any therapist with whom they have had good experience who has been omitted or by misfortune they have not encountered - <a href="http://sw12694.smart-web.dk/spinal-physiotherapy-contact-form/?completeurl" target="_blank"><strong>do please make contact</strong></a>. Likewise,&nbsp;we cannot take responsibility for the level of treatment you as an individual receive at any of the clinics featured. All we guarantee is that our experience, as seen in our patients' results, suggests that they are indeed highly skilled professionals able to help where help is possible.</p>
                    <p>Though based around London and the South East the reputation of the team at The Spine Surgery London&nbsp;brings patients from all over the country and around the world. Our list of physical therapists reflects this.</p>

                    <h3>What is here</h3>
                    <p>There are a great many different types of physical therapy applied to the spine: - physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, Pilates, hydrotherapy, ergonomics, massage, craniotomy-sacral therapy, yoga, Bikram yoga, McTimoney Chiropractic, Mackenzie, Alexander technique, Bowen technique, Reiki therapy, CHEK therapy ...... the list is almost endless.</p>
                    <p>Here are clinics and therapists who the team at The Spine Surgery London (Link to the page above) have worked with, often over the course of many years, and who have stood out as excellent in their diagnosis and management. They will often offer many of the therapies listed above.</p>

                    <h3>The Best Clinics</h3>
                    <p>Is ours the best system for selecting clinics? We think so. A broad range of top flight specialists have experienced the work of these clinics and found them to be the best &ndash; the ones they would go to if they were in need. </p>
                    <p>The answer to &ldquo;who would you see&rdquo; or &ldquo;who is the best&rdquo; is complex. There is almost always more than one way to treat any condition, every patient has individual needs and invariably multiple techniques and issues need addressing. A broad range of clinical skills are required as well as the experience and environment to apply them. </p>
                    <p>This gives you the template for a good clinic; it must have experienced people with broad skills. However, some individuals combine these and many big clinics are poorly managed or have a rapid turnover of people with limited skills and little experience. So, whilst you will see a general theme in the clinics we recommend they only get here after we have experienced their work.</p>

                    <h3>Honest and Free</h3>
                    <p>The team at The Spine Surgery London created this site to help their patients find high quality therapy close to home or work. The aim here is to make their experience accessible to all.</p>
                    <p>No money changes hands. The team decides who goes on the list on the basis of their experience. These clinics did not pay to be featured and never will. It is by our recommendation only. </p>
                    <p>Likewise we do not charge for access to the site &ndash; it is a gift. If you find the site helpful you might like to make a donation to our favourite charity the <a href="http://www.brainandspine.org.uk/ways-to-support-us"><strong>Brain and Spine Foundation</strong></a></p>

        <h1 style="color: #000">What is Physical Therapy?</h1>

    </div>

    <div class="container black-text">
<p>There are a huge range of physical therapies: physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, Pilates, hydrotherapy, massage, craniotomy-sacral therapy, yoga, Bikram yoga, McTimoney Chiropractic, Mackenzie, Alexander technique, Bowen technique, Reiki therapy, CHEK therapy, podiatry, myofascial release, Rolphing, neural glides, core muscle exercises...... an already almost endless it is expanding daily. In addition, there are many other active, passive and preventative strategies and techniques to apply: ergonomics, Mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy, nutritional therapy .&hellip;&hellip; again a long and expanding list. Some address multiple aspects of life such as CHEK therapy, whilst others address specific elements of a condition as in Myofascial Therapy, and yet others combine several with Body Balance doing this to music! Some are actually &ldquo;Mental Exercises&rdquo; and have been included as they are often an important element of any good programme. Look them up in the <strong><a href="/Encyclopaedia.html">Encylopaedia</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>It is common for the &ldquo;big three&rdquo; physical therapy disciplines of physiotherapy, osteopathy and chiropractic to utilise multiple techniques in an overall package of care.</p>
        <p>Essentially these therapies can be divided into three groups. We call these <strong>the three pillars</strong> of spinal care<strong>.</strong></p>
        <a name="three-pillars"></a>
        <h2><strong>The Three Pillars of Spinal Care</strong></h2>
        <p>Any successful treatment strategy has three core pillars. They are the minimum requirement &ndash; try standing on a two legged chair.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Passive physical therapy.</li>
            <li>Active physical therapy.</li>
            <li>Preventative(Ergonomic) strategies.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Passive physical therapy </strong>means you lie there and they do things; heat, massage, ultrasound, strapping/taping, acupuncture, manipulation etc. They aim to provide pain relief, rather like tablets; if they work, they work for a while, wear off and you need some more. They do not of themselves make you better. They provide pain relief and allow you to address the problems with a combination of active physical therapies and preventative/ergonomic strategies. They are an important part of any strategy but not the full answer. The injections doctors do, (epidurals, root sheath injections, facet joint injections and denervations), and the operations surgeons do, (discectomy, decompression, fusion) may be considered as &ldquo;big boy&rdquo; passive therapies.</p>
        <p><strong>Active physical therapy </strong>is exercise based. The therapist teaches you stretches and exercises to change posture, improve flexibility, strengthen muscle control and improve fitness. You are the one doing the work. It is only this active exercise which addresses the underlying treatable causes of the problem and ultimately stands any prospect of making you better. This may include stretching exercises to improve flexibility. To work on posture and strength it may include Pilates, Mackenzie exercises, yoga, gym work, or hydrotherapy. This is a rather black and white separation from passive therapy in what can be a complex mix of physical therapy interventions. Stretching exercise often requires a hands on technique to help fully. Additionally, the devil is in the detail. How you do the exercise is all important; it is their skill to teach you. It takes time, your time, to learn, perfect and then to do it in sufficient quantity for it to effectively change and improve you. Other active techniques can be learned and added that are not &ldquo;physical&rdquo; but &ldquo;mental&rdquo; therapies such as Mindfulness or cognitive behavioural therapy. As with the physical therapies they take time and commitment to learn. They too aim to make you stronger. Much of this involves learning &ndash; exercises, stretches and mental techniques. Likewise actively learning about your condition, its causes, natural history (what happens if nothing is done) and the treatments surrounding it is vital.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention and ergonomics</strong> You also need to stop doing whatever got you into trouble in the first place. Otherwise, history will repeat itself &ndash; in you! This is so often the forgotten pillar. <strong>Ergonomics</strong> is the science of doing things better. You need to look at what you do and change it. This does not mean giving up the things you do and love but doing them in a more back friendly way. For example, the thing most of us do most of, is work. Most offices are inactive environments. We sit too long. With some simple alterations we can change that and so live more comfortably and do more of the things we like &ndash; see &ldquo;Back Friendly Ergonomic Office&rdquo; page on The Spine Surgery London website. Click <strong><a href="http://sw12694.smart-web.dk/ergonomic-office/">here</a></strong> to visit that page. Failing to address this end of the seesaw will result in you needing more treatment and living with more pain than is necessary. Missing out this pillar is simply daft; it dooms all efforts on the other two pillars to failure. Expensive, it also risks unnecessary harm from treatment you should not need. Would you carry on simply filling up a car that leaked petrol? You may already be in trouble and prevention would certainly have been better than the cure you now need but it is absolutely essential that you make prevention a part of that cure. The most common omission in the treatment plans offered by therapists lies here.</p>
        <h2><strong>What Therapy Do I Need?</strong></h2>
        <p>For any condition, (back pain, neck pain, sciatica etc.), you need three things: a diagnosis, prescription of an appropriate treatment plan and the dispensing/delivery of that plan. As we have seen there are a myriad of treatments and specialists involved in spinal care. We hope here to provide guidance on how to make a sensible selection from the pool of experts available. To simplify the process we lay out <strong>the three needs</strong> you as a patient have and <strong>the three questions</strong> you must ask about the individual or clinic you choose.</p>


        <h2><strong>The Three Needs</strong></h2>
        <p>Spinal patients may a variety of symptoms: back pain, sciatica, neck pain or brachalgia,</p>
        <p>Whatever the problem all patients have three fundamental needs. They need a:-</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Diagnosis</strong> of what is causing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Prescription</strong> of all &ldquo;three pillars&rdquo; of treatment required to correct what is causing it.</li>
            <li><strong>Dispensing</strong> of that treatment.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, when assessing if you are going to see the correct specialist you need to ask <strong>the three questions</strong> of them or their clinic.</p>

        <h2><strong>The Three Questions </strong></h2>
        <p>You should consider the following three questions of the individual or clinic you are going to see:-</p>
        <ol>

            <li>Do I already know what is wrong and if not can they tell me? Click <strong><a href="#already-know-what-is-wrong" class="expand-1">Here</a> </strong>for more.</li>

            <li>Are they able to work out what is needed to correct it? Click <strong><a href="#work-out-what-is-needed"  class="expand-2">Here</a></strong> for more.</li>

            <li>Do they offer the range of skills required to treat it? Click <strong><a href="#skills-required-to-treat-it"  class="expand-3">Here</a> </strong>for more.</li>

        </ol>


        <div class="content-1">
            <a name="already-know-what-is-wrong"></a>
            <h4>1.Do I already know what is wrong and if not can they tell me?</h4>
            <p>Many of you will have seen a general physician, GP/family doctor or a specialist consultant in neurosurgery, orthopaedics, rheumatology or sport and exercise medicine. You may already have a diagnosis e.g., &ldquo;you have mechanical low back pain&rdquo;, &ldquo;your problem is sciatica&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Others of you may have suffered with episodes of back pain or neck pain in the past.</p>
            <p>For some this is the first attack of back pain or sciatica and in those circumstances most physical therapists can work out an initial diagnosis and initiate treatment. Providing there are no &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; features it is entirely reasonable for them to begin therapy and providing the treatment begins to relieve the symptoms over a few sessions that is all that is required. Indeed, this is the journey most patients take.</p>
            <p>If there are any &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; features or if the conditions fail to respond you may need to see a specialist. Certainly you need to discuss the situation with your doctor.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-2">
            <a name="work-out-what-is-needed"></a>
            <h4>2.Are they able to work out what is needed to correct it?</h4>
            <p>Most physical therapists, (physiotherapists, osteopaths and chiropractors), are skilled in working out what to do. They will prescribe a course of treatment including a mix of &ldquo;passive&rdquo; and &ldquo;active&rdquo; physical therapies as well as prevention and ergonomic advice. Certainly if they do not address all these three aspects, the &ldquo;three pillars&rdquo; as we have called them, you need to question if you are in the right place.</p>
