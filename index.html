                    <h3>Who created this site</h3>
<p><a href="http://sw12694.smart-web.dk"><strong>The Spine Surgery London</strong></a> has a multidisciplinary team of consultants specialising in all aspects of spinal care. Conducting over 6000 consultations a year, they have over 130 years of clinical experience between them. They provide medical services to premiere league football and rugby teams, World Cups, Olympic Games, NFL, horse racing, boxing, Grand Prix racing, The Royal Ballet, leading multinationals, stars of the stage and screen - as well as the rest of us! They have pioneered new treatments including the latest in endoscopic spinal surgery, artificial disc replacement and antibiotics for low back pain. They have expertise in orthopaedics, neurosurgery, neurology, rheumatology, sport and exercise medicine along with podiatry and ergonomics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over all these years, over all these levels and in all these disciplines their work has brought them into daily contact with physical therapists of all types: physiotherapists, osteopaths, chiropractics, acupuncturists Pilates instructors, massage therapists, personal trainers etc, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognising that these physical therapies form a crucial part patient care their aim here is to bring you the best physical therapists they have found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spine Surgery London apologises for any therapist with whom they have had good experience who has been omitted or by misfortune they have not encountered - <a href="http://sw12694.smart-web.dk/spinal-physiotherapy-contact-form/?completeurl" target="_blank"><strong>do please make contact</strong></a>. Likewise,&nbsp;we cannot take responsibility for the level of treatment you as an individual receive at any of the clinics featured. All we guarantee is that our experience, as seen in our patients' results, suggests that they are indeed highly skilled professionals able to help where help is possible.</p>
<p>Though based around London and the South East the reputation of the team at The Spine Surgery London&nbsp;brings patients from all over the country and around the world. Our list of physical therapists reflects this.</p>

<h3>What is here</h3>
<p>There are a great many different types of physical therapy applied to the spine: - physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, Pilates, hydrotherapy, ergonomics, massage, craniotomy-sacral therapy, yoga, Bikram yoga, McTimoney Chiropractic, Mackenzie, Alexander technique, Bowen technique, Reiki therapy, CHEK therapy ...... the list is almost endless.</p>
<p>Here are clinics and therapists who the team at The Spine Surgery London (Link to the page above) have worked with, often over the course of many years, and who have stood out as excellent in their diagnosis and management. They will often offer many of the therapies listed above.</p>

<h3>The Best Clinics</h3>
<p>Is ours the best system for selecting clinics? We think so. A broad range of top flight specialists have experienced the work of these clinics and found them to be the best &ndash; the ones they would go to if they were in need. </p>
<p>The answer to &ldquo;who would you see&rdquo; or &ldquo;who is the best&rdquo; is complex. There is almost always more than one way to treat any condition, every patient has individual needs and invariably multiple techniques and issues need addressing. A broad range of clinical skills are required as well as the experience and environment to apply them. </p>
<p>This gives you the template for a good clinic; it must have experienced people with broad skills. However, some individuals combine these and many big clinics are poorly managed or have a rapid turnover of people with limited skills and little experience. So, whilst you will see a general theme in the clinics we recommend they only get here after we have experienced their work.</p>

<h3>Honest and Free</h3>
<p>The team at The Spine Surgery London created this site to help their patients find high quality therapy close to home or work. The aim here is to make their experience accessible to all.</p>
<p>No money changes hands. The team decides who goes on the list on the basis of their experience. These clinics did not pay to be featured and never will. It is by our recommendation only. </p>
<p>Likewise we do not charge for access to the site &ndash; it is a gift. If you find the site helpful you might like to make a donation to our favourite charity the <a href="http://www.brainandspine.org.uk/ways-to-support-us"><strong>Brain and Spine Foundation</strong></a></p>

                   <p>There is a plethora of products available for back pain and neck pain sufferers. You can read about some of the thinking about it in our sections on ergonomics in our encyclopaedia of physical therapies and prevention/ergonomics in our section on The Three Pillars of Spinal Care.</p>
<p>Apart from difficulties in finding quality products from reliable suppliers it is hard to find all of the various items in one shop/site. Several of the team involved in this project have established Spine Group in an attempt to overcome this. You may visit their <a href="http://www.spinegroup.co.uk/">Spine Group</a> site and the <a href="http://www.spinegroup.co.uk/spinegroup/15-sit-stand-desks/">spine shop</a> now.

Eventually, the aim is to link the physical therapists directly into the suppliers so they can not only diagnose your ergonomic problems but prescribe solutions and direct you in purchases &ndash; coming soon!</p>
